      "full": "Emela-ntouka, meaning 'elephant killer' in Lingala, is a cryptid reported from the Congo Basin, particularly the Likouala swamp region. Described as elephant-sized or larger, brownish-gray in color, with a single ivory horn protruding from its snout, a heavy tail, and semi-aquatic habits. The creature is characterized as extremely aggressive, reportedly attacking elephants, hippopotamuses, and other large animals, goring them with its horn. Unlike the more famous Mokele-mbembe (long-necked dinosaur), Emela-ntouka is described as having a rhinoceros-like build. Local testimonies are remarkably consistent across different tribes in the region. No physical evidence has been obtained, and the creature remains entirely speculative. If it exists, some cryptozoologists theorize it could be a surviving ceratopsian dinosaur, though skeptics note the lack of evidence and biological implausibility."
